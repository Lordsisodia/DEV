# 🚀 SISO IDE - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 Your Custom IDE is Ready!

I've created a complete design and integration plan for transforming Claude Code UI into your custom **SISO IDE** - the world's first mobile-first AI development environment.

## 📁 What's Been Created

### 📋 Complete Documentation:
- **`SISO_CUSTOM_IDE_DESIGN_PLAN.md`** - Full vision, architecture, and roadmap

AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Step 3: Launch SISO IDE
```bash
./start-siso-ide.sh
# or
npm run dev:siso
```

- ✅ **Code anywhere** - phone, tablet, laptop
- ✅ **Voice-first development** - hands-free coding
- ✅ **Continuous context** - same project across devices
- ✅ **AI-enhanced mobile** - cognitive assistance everywhere

## 🔥 Revolutionary Features Coming

### Voice-Driven Development:
```
You: "Create a React component called UserProfile"
SISO: *Creates file, adds boilerplate, opens in editor*

You: "Add a function to fetch user data"
SISO: *Adds async function with proper error handling*

You: "Commit these changes with a good message"
SISO: *Stages files, creates descriptive commit*
```

### AI Cognitive Switching:
- **Architect Mode**: "Design a microservices architecture"
