        """Dynamically modify network architecture"""
        if modification_type == "add_layer":
            # Add new layer with random size

        """Generate sophisticated adversarial attacks"""
        if attack_type == AttackType.ADVERSARIAL_EXAMPLE:
            # FGSM-style attack with adaptive epsilon
            target_input.requires_grad_(True)
            output = self.attack_networks[attack_type.value](target_input)
            perturbation = epsilon * torch.sign(grad)
```

### Tournament Selection and Evolution

The framework implements sophisticated evolutionary algorithms:

    def evolve_population(self, population: List[NeuralAgent], 
                         survival_rate: float = 0.5,
                         mutation_rate: float = 0.1):
